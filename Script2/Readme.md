# Second Script
- This script is intended to download a static website from github and log all the steps inside a file that is named installation with the current date.
- After all the steps and logging them inside the log file the I added a cronjob to the end of the script to update the website daily at midnight using the git pull command

- To run the script all you need to do is just type the file name ./Script2.sh
  - Which will immediatly execute all these steps and generate a log file in the same directory as your script giving you the logs of the run.
